Note: All proposed changes are suggestions/ideas, until deemed final.


# Build 10 Change List


## Gameplay Options and Features
- Observers now start with 0 ru. When prompted to continue watching, click yes to observe.
- In the carrier only gamemode, all races now start with the same number of carriers.
- Added an extra tactical overlay level that keeps feedback lines and circles on all the time when desired.
- Added an option to change the default tactical overlay level.
- Added an option to show base build/research production times. (now that its in the info pop-up, remove option and leave it on all the time.)


## HWR Bugs Fixes and Improvements
- Whenever someone sends a private message, everyone in the lobby hears the sound even when they are not the recipient. Removed the sound, as the chat window already visually flashes for the recipient.
- ‘Platform Complete’ audio is now played for Vaygr Gun Platforms and Missile Platforms (they were missing)
-- Note: these sounds aren't localized, same goes for the prior sound fixes.
- Fixed the hyperspace in inhibitor exploit.
- The score screen building and research total now treats ru spent on subsystems the same as ru spent on research.
- HW1 cruisers no longer take hyperspace damage.
- When a docking squadron is under attack, they sometimes glitch and stop. This issues another dock order to dock with the closest ship.
- Prevented HW1 players from building two research ships at once on separate carriers.
- Reduced the kushan probe death explosion to a reasonable size
- Tweaked the advanced research module icon to differentiate it more from the regular research module icon.
- Fixed the salvage scuttle exploit.
- Trebic's Grav Fix (So ships are no longer locked down after it moves away).
- Hiig Marine, Vay Infil frigs, and all minelayer corvettes are no longer included in the military selection.
- Don't mention: Improved text spacing in the build/research menues.
- No Cruisers option text now displays in your current language rather than only English.
